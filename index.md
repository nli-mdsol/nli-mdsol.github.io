### Brief Bio
Nan Li is a lead software engineer in test at [Medidata Solutions](http://www.mdsol.com). He is leading the research on [big data testing](http://techblog.mdsol.com/2015/05/15/generating-a-representative-data-set-from-big-data.html), model-based testing, mutation testing, test oracle, fault localization, mobile testing, and test automation. He is developing several big data, mobile, and other general-purpose testing tools. He is passionate about bridging the gap between academia and industry.

Nan Li received PhD in Information Technology with concentration on software engineering from [Volgenau School of Engineering](volgenau.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu) in 2014. His advisor was [Dr. Jeff Offutt](http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt). He received a B.E. in Software Engineering from [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn) in 2006. 


### Projects at Medidata
#### Mobile Testing
Developing a test framework in Ruby for testing iOS and Android apps, using [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium). Working on Xcode 8, XCUITest, uiautomator2, and Appium now.

#### Reporting and Big Data Testing
Developed programs and tests using Amazon Web Services (AWS) techniques for reporting and analytics.
Developed a test data generator that generates small yet effective test data sets from original big data.
