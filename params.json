  "body": "### Brief Bio\r\nNan Li is a lead software engineer in test at [Medidata Solutions](http://www.mdsol.com). He is leading the research on [big data testing](http://techblog.mdsol.com/2015/05/15/generating-a-representative-data-set-from-big-data.html), model-based testing, mutation testing, test oracle, fault localization, mobile testing, and test automation. He is developing several big data, mobile, and other general-purpose testing tools. He is passionate about bridging the gap between academia and industry.\r\n\r\nNan Li received PhD in Information Technology with concentration on software engineering from [Volgenau School of Engineering](volgenau.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu) in 2014. His advisor was [Dr. Jeff Offutt](http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt). He received a B.E. in Software Engineering from [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn) in 2006. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects at Medidata\r\n#### Mobile Testing\r\nDeveloping a test framework in Ruby for testing iOS and Android apps, using [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium). Working on Xcode 8, XCUITest, uiautomator2, and Appium 1.6.0 now.\r\n\r\n#### Reporting and Big Data Testing\r\nDeveloped programs and tests using Amazon Web Services (AWS) techniques for reporting and analytics.\r\nDeveloped a test data generator that generates small yet effective test data sets from original big data.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n### Big Data Testing\r\n+ **Nan Li**, Yu Lei, Haider Khan, Jingshu Liu, and Yun Guo.
